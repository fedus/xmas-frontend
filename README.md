My first try at building (hacking together) a Vue JS 2 app. Used as a web frontend for an Arduiono based fairy light controller.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
